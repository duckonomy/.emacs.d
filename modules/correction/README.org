# *Flyspell*
#
# This should be fixed and selectively hooked
#
# =FIXED=: Not using it because in org “c-<” maps to something else
# =TODO=: Make hook to disable on larger org files like this one, or maybe just specific files

# *Typo*

# Don't hook to text-mode because it messes up quotes in org-mode. Only use on demand. (or create a prose major mode)
