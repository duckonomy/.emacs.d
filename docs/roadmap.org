#+TITLE: Roadmap
* Problem with structure
** Projectile does not capture el files... <- biggest problem
** I have to manually include files
* DONE https://github.com/jixiuf/vterm-toggle
* Better logic for new buffer (like create new buffer)
* Get rid of most global minor modes
* Change structuring so that core is actually core and others are other
** like dired (it relies on external packages)
** Get rid of ambiguous stuff like keybindings
* Buffer Switching
 - *Bufler*
   - Complex Groups
 - *My own implementations*
   - Define IBuffer Groups
   - Switch Window Within Current Group (~C-x b~)
   - Switch Window Among All Groups (~C-x M-b~ or just IBuffer (~C-x C-b~))
   - Cycle Buffer Within Group (~C-tab~, ~C-iso-lefttab~)
   - Cycle All Buffer (~C-M-tab~, ~C-M-iso-lefttab~)
   - Select Group (~C-x C-g~ - check availability)

* Move posframe to UI

* Transition into files
 - but leave ~README.org~ for documentation on Github

* External
** NixOS Overlay?

 - https://github.com/rememberYou/.emacs.d/blob/master/config.org/#alert
 - https://ladicle.com/post/config/
** Switch Left mod in Xkeyboard to right mod (to make it real )
+Things like ~C-M-h~ do not work right now+
Seems to be something deeper lol  xkeyboard fix doesn't work either
* Internal

 - Use EPA
** Split README.org into smaller files
 - Indexing? in main elc (maybe just seqentially) like when you need to edit a single file that is at the bottom part of the whole config how do you insert that?
 - Maybe just logical splitting
** Better m-x
 - https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ehjcu2/screenshot_polishing_my_emacs_who_said_an_old/
** Conditional Binary Compilation/External Acts and fallback
 - pdf-tools (fallback docview)

 - Better Ctrl-tab
   - cycle within related buffers
     - terminals with terminals
     - text buffers with text buffers
     - dired with dired
     - error/messages with other messages
     - blacklists
 - Better kill buffer mechanism
   - map rotation to c-r because c-s is ~swiper~ - don't know why?****** TODO map kill to c-q
   - After kill, go to related buffer
 - Fix kill-them-buffers
   - make it kill frame on last tab
   - or make a base buffer
   - logic to make sole buffers remain even when kill when duplicate
** Better Window Manager
 - Resize/Move
 - Ace Window (See Under # Applications)
 - If window is sole window don't kill but just close buffer else kill buffer and close window [How to get number of user windows]
